# TaskMaster-Flex
Many of us struggle with balancing time to be productive and leisure time. TaskMaster-Flex is a game that gives you the best of both worlds. While fun and challenging, TMF is rewarding in all the ways of your favorite dungeon crawlers, while incentivizing you to accomplish all of the tasks and goals you set for yourself each day.

## Description

### What was our motivation?
- Well, to put it simply, fun! Who doesn't love games? Everyone, from very young children, to the young at heart, to the not-so-young at heart love games of all kinds. From simple board games and basic "old-school" classics like Pong, to the massively advanced RPG's of today, to the mind controllers that are casino games, there are games for everyone!

### Why did we build this project?
- We thought "What if there were a game that you could play, where the advancement that you could make in the game was directly tied into how much progress you made on your daily tasks in real life?". It turns out that one already existed. We thought we might be able to improve upon that concept.

### What problems does it solve?
- Lack of motivation
- Task prioritization
- Building positive habits
- Combining work and play
- Increased accountability
- Stress relief and mental well-being

Overall, the app aims to address motivational challenges, improve task management and prioritization, bridge work and play, foster positive habits, increase accountability, and promote stress relief and mental well-being.

### What did we learn?
- How to more thoroughly incorporate multiple moving pieces of the JavaScript ecosystem.
- Game developement principles
  - Developing a game of this style involves understanding basic game mechanics, character progression, level design, and user interactions.
- Gamification of real-world tasks
